### Code Generator for UML to Java
This project can be used to convert a UML .classdiagram file
to a .java file, assuming the class diagram file has correct 
syntax.

### How To Use
Note: Must have Python installed to run

Open this directory in terminal, and run the UMLtoJavaConverter.py file using:
```
python3 .\UMLtoJavaConverter.py
```
This will prompt you to enter a filename for the classdiagram.

Enter the filename with the extension included (i.e. UML.classdiagram)

This will create a .java file with the same name, or if the file already
exists, it will overwrite the file.
